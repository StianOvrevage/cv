- project:
  title: Integrated monitoring system (IMS)
  link: ""
  tagline: "A PHP-based web application that collects real-time data from CRM systems via Oracle SQL, 
  provisioning systems via SOAP API, customer premise equipment via telnet and network 
  equipment in the field via SNMP. Allows first-line support in Kvinnherad Breiband to 
  solve 80-90% of incoming requests without escalating to technical personnel. Used several times per hour for 5-6 years."
- project:
  title: "Responsible for migrating IPTV from Altibox to Get."
  link: "http://www.mynewsdesk.com/no/get/pressreleases/get-styrker-tv-tilbodet-i-kvinnherad-655729"
  tagline: "During spring and summer 2011 Kvinnherad Breiband switched providers of IPTV services from Altibox to Get.
  This included preparing the network for running both IPTV networks simultaneously during the migration.
  It required ingenuity to accomplish this \"in flight\" both accounting for configuration complexity and
  available network bandwidth without causing downtime or degradation of services. We also surveyed 1500
  customers and updated CRM systems with new subscription preferences and mapped this to new set-top-box
  MAC-addresses for each customer. Total preparations took us 2-3 months for 1-2 people. Migration was
  done in stages of 4-500 set-top-boxes per week, with 2-3 people managing support calls on the days of delivery.
  Everything went better than expected and the last week we doubled the delivery pace and delivered 1000 set-top-boxes."
